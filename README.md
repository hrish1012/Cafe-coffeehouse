Coffee House is a cafe website developed using ReactJS which showcases the front-end of a coffee cafe.

I've developed this website to study ReactJS and Hooks, responsive design, animations, and good practices in front-end development. 


If you're craving a virtual coffee experience, head over to Coffeeshop today!
